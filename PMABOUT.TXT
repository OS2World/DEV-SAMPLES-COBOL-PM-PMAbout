   written in COBOL.  It contains code to support processing of
   messages from an applications message queue.  It demonstrates
   how to code a dialog procedures and a message box.

   This program is discussed in the January 1993 issue of the IBM
   Personal Systems Technical Solutions. This program was written
   at the IBM OS/2 Application Assistance Center by Chris Fierros.

   PMABOUT was written using OS/2 2.0, the OS/2 2.0 Developer's Toolkit,
   and Micro Focus COBOL Version 3.0.23.
